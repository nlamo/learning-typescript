# learning-typescript

Most of this code is written from or with the assistance of the grey O'Reilly text, 'Programming TypeScript: Making Your JavaScript Applications Scale'.

Some of this is just for reference/education, but the main thing of interest here is the continuation of a chess engine that the author starts in 'Chapter 5: Classes and Interfaces'.

I've included the transpiled JS files along with the TS files.
